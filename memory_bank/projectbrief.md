# PROJECT BRIEF - Simple NAS

## Project Overview

**Name**: Simple NAS (Network Attached Storage)
**Language**: Rust
**Type**: System application/File server

## Project Context

This appears to be a Rust-based simple Network Attached Storage (NAS) solution. Based on the directory structure observed:

- Primary language: Rust (Cargo.toml, src/ directory present)
- Has UI component (ui/ directory)
- Includes specifications (specs/ directory)
- Has examples and fixtures for testing
- Uses standard Rust tooling (Cargo, deny.toml for security auditing)

## Initial Observations

- Project uses Rust toolchain
- Has cliff.toml (likely for changelog generation)
- Includes pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Has proper gitignore and licensing (LICENSE.md)
- Structured with examples and test fixtures

## Complexity Assessment Required

Need to determine if this is:
- Level 1: Quick bug fix
- Level 2: Simple enhancement  
- Level 3: Intermediate feature addition
- Level 4: Complex system modification

**Next Step**: Analyze user requirements to determine complexity level and appropriate workflow.
