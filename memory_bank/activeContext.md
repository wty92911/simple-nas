# ACTIVE CONTEXT - Memory Bank

## Current Project Status
**Project**: Simple Home NAS
**Mode**: ðŸ§­ **PLAN MODE** - Implementation Task Planning âœ…
**Complexity**: Level 4 Complex System  
**Platform**: macOS (Darwin) with cross-platform targets

## Current Phase Progress
- **Planning Phase**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Creative Phases**: 2/5 COMPLETED (API Design, Security Model)
- **Implementation Planning**: âœ… COMPLETED - Detailed tasks created
- **Implementation Status**: ðŸš€ **READY TO START** - Foundation components

## Completed Creative Phases âœ…
1. **API Design & Data Flow** - REST architecture with secure endpoints
2. **Security Model Implementation** - JWT auth, rate limiting, comprehensive security

## Immediate Implementation-Ready Components ðŸš€

### Week 1-2: Foundation (Critical Path)
1. **Project Structure Setup** (2 days) - Can start IMMEDIATELY
2. **Database Schema & Migrations** (2 days) - Complete schema designed
3. **Security Infrastructure** (3 days) - Comprehensive architecture ready

### Week 3: Core Operations
4. **File Operations** (3 days) - API + security integration designed
5. **Sharing System** (2 days) - Secure sharing architecture ready

## Blocked Components ðŸŽ¨
- **Frontend UI Components** - Requires UI Architecture creative phase
- **Media Processing** - Requires creative architecture phase
- **Performance Optimization** - Requires creative strategy phase

## Technology Stack âœ… VALIDATED
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum + SQLite + Tokio
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS  
- **Security**: JWT + Argon2 + TLS
- **Build**: Cargo + npm + GitHub Actions

## Next Immediate Actions

### Option 1: START IMPLEMENTATION (RECOMMENDED)
**Advantages**: 2-3 weeks of work ready to begin, critical foundation components
**Action**: Transition to **IMPLEMENT MODE** with Task 1.1 (Project Setup)

### Option 2: CONTINUE CREATIVE PHASES  
**Advantages**: Complete UI Architecture for unblocked frontend development
**Action**: Continue in **CREATIVE MODE** with UI Architecture (3-4 days)

### Option 3: HYBRID APPROACH
**Advantages**: Parallel progress on backend implementation and frontend design
**Action**: Begin implementation while planning UI creative phase

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK**: Foundation implementation (fully designed)
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Creative phase dependencies for frontend
- **MITIGATION**: Start with backend foundation, parallel creative planning

## Recommended Decision
**START IMPLEMENT MODE** - Begin with Task 1.1 (Project Structure Setup) as critical foundation components are fully ready and will unblock significant development progress.
