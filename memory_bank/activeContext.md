# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## Current Session Focus

**Mode**: PLAN MODE (Level 4 Complex System Planning)
**Phase**: Architectural Planning and Requirements Analysis
**Complexity Level**: **LEVEL 4** - Complex System Implementation
**Platform**: macOS (Darwin) with zsh shell

## Current Context

### Project State
- Working in: `/Users/terrytywang/Desktop/Code/rust_space/simple-nas`
- Project Type: **Simple Home NAS - Full-Stack System**
- Requirements Source: `specs/000-design-prd.md`
- Architecture: Rust Backend + React Frontend + Media Service

### System Overview (from PRD)
- **Goal**: Lightweight, self-hosted NAS server with modern web interface
- **Components**: File management, media streaming, authentication, sharing
- **Performance**: ≥100 MB/s transfer, <200ms API latency
- **Security**: HTTPS, Argon2/scrypt, CSRF protection, rate limiting
- **Deployment**: Cross-platform (macOS, Linux x86_64, ARM/Raspberry Pi)

### Memory Bank Status
- ✅ Platform detection completed
- ✅ Memory Bank structure created
- ✅ Complexity determination → **LEVEL 4 CONFIRMED**
- ✅ Mode transition to PLAN MODE
- 🔄 **CURRENT**: Comprehensive requirements analysis
- ⏳ Architectural planning in progress
- ⏳ Creative phase identification pending

### Level 4 Planning Requirements

#### Multi-Phase Development (6 Phases)
- **Phase 0**: Project scaffolding, repo layout, CI setup
- **Phase 1**: Core MVP (Auth, browse, CRUD, storage status, UI)
- **Phase 2**: Security & Quality (HTTPS, hashing, CSRF, transfers, scanner)
- **Phase 3**: Sharing & Search (Public links, filename search)
- **Phase 4**: Media Service (Image thumbnails, video playback)
- **Phase 5**: Hardening & Packaging (Cross-compile, Docker, docs, tests)
- **Phase 6**: Stretch Enhancements (Multi-user, resume, transcoding)

#### Architectural Subsystems
- **Backend (Rust)**: API layer, File manager, Media module, Auth, Scheduler
- **Frontend (React)**: Auth pages, File explorer, Media viewers, Transfer queue
- **Data Flow**: Browser ⇆ HTTPS ⇆ Rust API ⇆ Local filesystem + metadata

#### Technical Constraints
- ≤2 GB RAM, single CPU core acceptable
- Local filesystem only, no external object storage
- Embedded store (SQLite) or file-based metadata
- Open-source licenses exclusively

## Immediate Next Steps (PLAN Mode)

### Phase 3: Architectural Planning
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Document comprehensive functional/non-functional requirements
2. **Business Context**: Document stakeholder needs and constraints
3. **Architecture Alternatives**: Explore different architectural approaches
4. **Technology Stack**: Finalize Rust/React technology decisions
5. **Component Design**: Define system components and interfaces
6. **Integration Points**: Design component interactions
7. **Security Architecture**: Plan authentication, authorization, HTTPS
8. **Performance Architecture**: Plan for transfer speeds and latency requirements

### Creative Phase Identification
Components requiring creative design decisions:
- **Media Processing Architecture**: Thumbnail generation, video streaming
- **File Transfer Optimization**: Large file handling, progress tracking
- **Authentication System**: JWT vs signed cookies, session management
- **Database Schema**: Metadata storage, file indexing
- **API Design**: REST endpoints, error handling, streaming
- **UI/UX Architecture**: Responsive design, drag-and-drop, theming

## Technical Context

### Current System Analysis
- **Existing Structure**: Well-organized Rust project foundation
- **Build System**: Cargo with proper tooling (deny.toml, pre-commit)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive PRD with clear requirements
- **Testing**: Examples and fixtures directories present

### Planning Outputs Required
- Comprehensive requirements analysis document
- Architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Component interaction diagrams
- Technology stack justification
- Implementation roadmap with phases
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Success Criteria for PLAN Mode

- [ ] Complete requirements analysis from PRD
- [ ] Document architectural alternatives and selection rationale
- [ ] Create comprehensive system architecture diagrams
- [ ] Identify all components requiring Creative Phase
- [ ] Define implementation phases with dependencies
- [ ] Document risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Update all Memory Bank documents with planning results
- [ ] Ready for transition to Creative Phase or Implementation
